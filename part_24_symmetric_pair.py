"""
Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are said to be symmetric if c is equal to b and a is equal to d. For example, (10, 20) and (20, 10) are symmetric. Given an array of pairs find all symmetric pairs in it. 
It may be assumed that the first elements of all pairs are distinct.
Example: 

Input: arr[] = {{11, 20}, {30, 40}, {5, 10}, {40, 30}, {10, 5}}
Output: Following pairs have symmetric pairs
        (30, 40)
        (5, 10)

emove minimum elements from either side such that 2*min becomes more than max
Last Updated : 18 Sep, 2023
Given an unsorted array, trim the array such that twice of minimum is greater than maximum in the trimmed array. Elements should be removed either end of the array.
Number of removals should be minimum.

Examples: 

arr[] = {4, 5, 100, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 200}
Output: 4
We need to remove 4 elements (4, 5, 100, 200)
so that 2*min becomes more than max.


arr[] = {4, 7, 5, 6}
Output: 0
We don't need to remove any element as 
4*2 > 7 (Note that min = 4, max = 8)

arr[] = {20, 7, 5, 6}
Output: 1
We need to remove 20 so that 2*min becomes
more than max

arr[] = {20, 4, 1, 3}
Output: 3
We need to remove any three elements from ends
like 20, 4, 1 or 4, 1, 3 or 20, 3, 1 or 20, 4, 1
We strongly recommend that you click here and practice it, before moving on to the solution.
Naive Solution: 

A naive solution is to try every possible case using recurrence. Following is the naive recursive algorithm. Note that the algorithm only returns minimum numbers of removals to be made, it doesnâ€™t print the trimmed array. It can be easily modified to print the trimmed array as well. 

// Returns minimum number of removals to be made in
// arr[l..h]
minRemovals(int arr[], int l, int h)
1) Find min and max in arr[l..h]
2) If 2*min > max, then return 0.
3) Else return minimum of "minRemovals(arr, l+1, h) + 1"
   and "minRemovals(arr, l, h-1) + 1"
Following is the implementation of above algorithm.

"""
Given a sorted array of positive integers. Your task is to rearrange the array elements alternatively i.e first element should be max value, second should be min value, third should be second max, fourth should be second min and so on.
Note: Modify the original array itself. Do it without using any extra space. You do not have to return anything.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Output: 6 1 5 2 4 3
Explanation: Max element = 6, min = 1, 
second max = 5, second min = 2, and 
so on... Modified array is : 6 1 5 2 4 3.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 11
arr[]={10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110}
Output:110 10 100 20 90 30 80 40 70 50 60
Explanation: Max element = 110, min = 10, 
second max = 100, second min = 20, and 
so on... Modified array is : 
110 10 100 20 90 30 80 40 70 50 60.
